# Duplicate Regex Checker

## Introduction  ‚ñ∂Ô∏è:
The following is a small java based application that will remove duplicate words from a string and print the correct sentence to the console.

## HackerRank Problem :duck:
In this challenge, we use regular expressions (RegEx) to remove instances of words that are repeated more than once, but retain the first occurrence of any case-insensitive repeated word. For example, the words love and to are repeated in the sentence I love Love to To tO code. Please complete the code in the editor so it will turn I love Love to To tO code into I love to code

### HackerRank Level:rabbit:
```diff
- Medium
```

## Set-up üíæ
Import project as a java based application
